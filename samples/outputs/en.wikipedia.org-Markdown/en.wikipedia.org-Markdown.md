# Markdown

**Markdown**[9] is a [lightweight markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language) for creating [formatted text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formatted_text) using a [plain-text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor). [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) created Markdown in 2004 as an easy-to-read [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language).[9] Markdown is widely used for [blogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog), [instant messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging), and [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_models),[10] and also used elsewhere in [online forums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_forums), [collaborative software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_software), [documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation) pages, and [readme files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README).

The initial description of Markdown[11] contained ambiguities and raised unanswered questions, causing implementations to both intentionally and accidentally diverge from the original version. This was addressed in 2014 when long-standing Markdown contributors released CommonMark, an unambiguous specification and test suite for Markdown.[12]

## History

Markdown was inspired by pre-existing [conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)) for marking up [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) in [email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email) and [usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) posts,[13] such as the earlier markup languages [setext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setext) ([*c.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circa) 1992), [Textile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)) ([*c.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circa) 2002), and [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) ([*c.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circa) 2002).[9]

In 2002, [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) created [atx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atx_(markup_language)) and referred to it as "the true structured text format". Gruber created the Markdown language in 2004 with Swartz as his "sounding board".[14] The goal of the language was to enable people "to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, optionally convert it to structurally valid [XHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML) (or [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML))".[5]

Another key design goal was *readability*, that the language be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions,[9] unlike text formatted with "heavier" [markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language), such as [Rich Text Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format) (RTF), HTML, or even [wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikitext), each of which have obvious in-line tags and formatting instructions which can make the text more difficult for humans to read.

Gruber wrote a [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) script, Markdown.pl, which converts marked-up text input to valid, [well-formed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_document) XHTML or HTML, encoding angle brackets (&lt;, &gt;) and [ampersands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand) (&amp;), which would be misinterpreted as special characters in those languages. It can take the role of a standalone script, a plugin for [Blosxom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blosxom) or [Movable Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type), or of a text filter for [BBEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBEdit).[5]

## Rise and divergence

As Markdown's popularity grew rapidly, many Markdown [implementations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation) appeared, driven mostly by the need for additional features such as [tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information)), [footnotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_(typography)), definition lists,[note 1] and Markdown inside HTML blocks.

The behavior of some of these diverged from the reference implementation, as Markdown was only characterised by an informal [specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard))[17] and a [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) implementation for conversion to HTML.

<!-- ai-edited: Removed the site navigation link; reordered the infobox content into its printed position within the article flow and omitted its labels/values from the text flow where appropriate? Wait image shows infobox; preserve it. Need include table! -->

<!-- page: 2 -->

At the same time, a number of ambiguities in the informal specification had attracted attention.[18] These issues spurred the creation of tools such as Babelmark[19][20] to compare the output of various implementations,[21] and an effort by some developers of Markdown [parsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) for standardization. However, Gruber has argued that complete standardization would be a mistake: "Different sites (and people) have different needs. No one syntax would make all happy."[22]

Gruber avoided using curly braces in Markdown to unofficially reserve them for implementation-specific extensions.[23]

## CommonMark

### Standardization

In 2012, a group of people, including [Jeff Atwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood) and [John MacFarlane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_MacFarlane_(philosopher)), launched what Atwood characterised as a standardization effort.[12]

A community website now aims to "document various tools and resources available to document authors and developers, as well as implementors of the various Markdown implementations".[26]

### Name

In September 2014, Gruber objected to the usage of "Markdown" in the name of this effort and it was rebranded as "CommonMark".[13][27][28] CommonMark.org published several versions of a specification, reference implementation, test suite, and "[plans] to announce a finalized 1.0 spec and test suite in 2019".[29] A finalized 1.0 spec has not been released, as major issues still remain unsolved.[30]

### Adoption

![Table screenshot](images/table-p0002-1.png)

Nonetheless, several websites and projects have adopted CommonMark, including [Codeberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeberg), [Discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_(software)), [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub), [GitLab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitLab), [Reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit), [Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)), [Stack Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange) ([Stack Overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow)), and [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)).

In March 2016, two relevant informational Internet [RFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) were published:

- RFC [7763 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7763)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7763) - "The text/markdown Media Type,"[2] Informational. Introduces [MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME) type text/markdown.
- RFC [7764 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7764)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7764) - "Guidance on Markdown: Design Philosophies, Stability Strategies, and Select Registrations,"[7] Informational. Discusses and registers the variants [MultiMarkdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMarkdown), GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), [Pandoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandoc), and Markdown Extra (among others).[31]

## Variants

Websites including [Bitbucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitbucket), [Diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora_(social_network)), [Discord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord),[32] GitHub,[33] [OpenStreetMap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap), [Reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit),[34] [SourceForge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge)[35] and [Stack Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange)[36] use variants of Markdown to make discussions between users easier.

Depending on implementation, basic inline [HTML tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_tag) may be supported.[37]

Italic text may be implemented by _underscores_ or *single-asterisks*.[38]

<!-- ai-edited: Corrected citation marker rendering and paragraph/list flow to match page image.; Linked John MacFarlane in the infobox as listed. -->

<!-- page: 3 -->

Many platforms implement spoiler formatting that hides text until hovered, clicked or tapped. The most common markup is ||spoiler|| used by Discord [39], Telegram [40][41], various Matrix clients [42], now defunct Guilded [43], a forum called Flarum [44], a NodeBB plugin [45], the imageboard engine JSChan [46] and possibly more.

### GitHub Flavored Markdown

[GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) had been using its own variant of Markdown since as early as 2009, [47] which added support for additional formatting such as tables and nesting [block content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Block_elements) inside list elements, as well as GitHub-specific features such as autolinking references to commits, issues, usernames, etc.

In 2017, GitHub released a formal specification of its [GitHub Flavored Markdown (https://github.github.com/gfm/)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (GFM) that is based on [CommonMark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonMark). [33] It is a [strict superset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superset) of CommonMark, following its specification exactly except for tables, [strikethrough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikethrough), [autolinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_hyperlinking) and task lists, which GFM adds as extensions. [48]

Accordingly, GitHub also changed the parser used on their sites, which required that some documents be changed. For instance, GFM now requires that the [hash symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign) that creates a heading be separated from the heading text by a space character.

### Markdown Extra

Markdown Extra is a [lightweight markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language) based on Markdown implemented in [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) (originally), [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)). [49] It adds the following features that are not available with regular Markdown:

- Markdown markup inside [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) blocks
- Elements with id/class attribute
- "Fenced code blocks" that span multiple lines of code
- Tables [49]
- Definition lists
- Footnotes
- Abbreviations

Markdown Extra is supported in some [content management systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) such as [Drupal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal), [50] [Grav (CMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grav_(CMS)), [Textpattern CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textpattern) [51] and [TYPO3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TYPO3).

## Implementations

Language">HTML</abbr> tags are supported.</p>

Most inline HTML tags are supported.

Implementations of Markdown are available for over a dozen [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language); in addition, many [applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software), platforms and [frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework) support Markdown. [53] For example, Markdown [plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)) exist for every major [blogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) platform. [13]

While Markdown is a minimal markup language and is read and edited with a normal [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor), there are specially designed editors that preview the files with styles, which are available for all major platforms. Many general-purpose text and [code editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-code_editor) have [syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting) plugins for Markdown built into them or available as optional download. Editors may feature a side-by-side preview window or render the code directly in a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) fashion.
